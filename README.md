## Overview

This assignment demonstrates mastery of while loops, for loops, and nested loops through four programming challenges. Each challenge was selected to showcase the appropriate loop type for different problem scenarios.

---

## Loop Type Analysis

### Step 1: Collatz Sequence - While Loop

**Why while loop?**  
[Explain why a while loop is the best choice for this problem. Consider: Do you know how many iterations beforehand? What condition determines when to stop?]

**How it works:**  
[Provide a brief explanation of your implementation. What variables did you use? How does your loop condition work?]

**Example:**
```
Enter starting number: 13
Sequence: 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
Steps: 9
```

---

### Step 2: Prime Checker - For Loop

**Why for loop?**  
[Explain why a for loop is the best choice for this problem. Consider: Do you know the range of values to check? Is the iteration count predictable?]

**How it works:**  
[Provide a brief explanation of your implementation. How do you test for divisibility? What happens when you find a divisor?]

**Example:**
```
Enter a number: 17
Testing divisors from 2 to 16...
17 is prime!
```

---

### Step 3: Multiplication Table - Nested Loops

**Why nested loops?**  
[Explain why nested loops are necessary for this problem. What does the outer loop do? What does the inner loop do?]

**Outer vs Inner:**  
[Explain which loop handles rows and which handles columns, and why this organization makes sense.]

**How it works:**  
[Provide a brief explanation of your implementation. How did you format the output? What techniques did you use for alignment?]

**Example:**
```
Multiplication Table:
    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
 1  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
 2  2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20
...
```

### Step 4: Statistics Dashboard - All Three Loop Types

**Why all three?**  
[Explain why this problem requires all three loop types:]
- **While loop:** [What part uses while and why?]
- **For loop:** [What part uses for and why?]
- **Nested loops:** [What part uses nested loops and why?]

**How it works:**  
[Provide a comprehensive explanation of your implementation:]
- How you collect data
- How you calculate statistics
- How you create the bar chart

**Example:**
```
=== Statistics Dashboard ===
Enter positive numbers (enter -1 to finish):
Enter number: 5
Enter number: 12
Enter number: 8
Enter number: 15
Enter number: 3
Enter number: -1

=== Statistics ===
Count: 5 numbers
Sum: 43
Average: 8.6
Minimum: 3
Maximum: 15

=== Bar Chart ===
 5: *****
12: ************
 8: ********
15: ***************
 3: ***
```

### Edge Cases Considered

[List any edge cases you thought about or tested:]
- Example: What happens with very large numbers in Collatz?
- Example: How does the prime checker handle 2?
- Example: What if user enters only one number in statistics?
